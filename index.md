## GENE NAMES ON THE FLY


### Stardust

The stardust (sdt) gene encodes a membrane-associated guanylate kinase. During organogenesis, epithelial cell structure in flies with a mutation in sdt breaks down, causing cells to form clusters form clusters. This occurs due to sdt’s role in the membrane and cell polarity. The clustered cell phenotype gives stardust its name.

### Hamlet:
The hamlet (ham) gene encodes a transcription factor. Flies with a mutation in ham change the fate of IIB descendant cells. IIB descendants usually differentiate into a multiple-dendrite neuron, external sensory neuron, and glia. Ham mutant flies have cells that differentiate into two multiple-dendrite neurons and a trichogen. Given ham’s regulation of IIB cell fate, the gene is named for Hamlet’s famous “to be or not to be” soliloquy.

### Dissatisfaction: 
The dissatisfaction gene (dsf) encodes for transcriptional repressor activity and is located on the second chromosome. This gene is involved in sex-specific courtship behaviors. A mutation in this gene results in abnormalities in courtship behaviors - such as females resisting males during courtship and copulation resulting in a failure to lay fertilized eggs, and males actively courting and attempting copulation with both males and females. The end result is some serious dissatisfaction among male and female fruit flies!

### Breathless:
	The breathless gene (btl) encodes a fibroblast growth factor-activated receptor located on the third chromosome. Flies with mutations in this gene will exhibit defects in the two embryonic tissues in which the receptor is expressed: the tracheal system and the midline. Breathless is required at the initiation of tracheal cell migration and mutants will struggle to breathe!
