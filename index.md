## GENE NAMES ON THE FLY


### Stardust

The stardust (sdt) gene encodes a membrane-associated guanylate kinase. During organogenesis, epithelial cell structure in flies with a mutation in sdt breaks down, causing cells to form clusters form clusters. This occurs due to sdt’s role in the membrane and cell polarity. The clustered cell phenotype gives stardust its name.

### Hamlet:
The hamlet (ham) gene encodes a transcription factor. Flies with a mutation in ham change the fate of IIB descendant cells. IIB descendants usually differentiate into a multiple-dendrite neuron, external sensory neuron, and glia. Ham mutant flies have cells that differentiate into two multiple-dendrite neurons and a trichogen. Given ham’s regulation of IIB cell fate, the gene is named for Hamlet’s famous “to be or not to be” soliloquy.

### Dissatisfaction: 
The dissatisfaction gene (dsf) encodes for transcriptional repressor activity and is located on the second chromosome. This gene is involved in sex-specific courtship behaviors. A mutation in this gene results in abnormalities in courtship behaviors - such as females resisting males during courtship and copulation resulting in a failure to lay fertilized eggs, and males actively courting and attempting copulation with both males and females. The end result is some serious dissatisfaction among male and female fruit flies!

### Breathless:
The breathless gene (btl) encodes a fibroblast growth factor-activated receptor located on the third chromosome. Flies with mutations in this gene will exhibit defects in the two embryonic tissues in which the receptor is expressed: the tracheal system and the midline. Breathless is required at the initiation of tracheal cell migration and mutants will struggle to breathe!

### Bag of Marbles:
Gamete development in Drosophila starts with the formation of precursor cystocytes in both males and females. These cysts differentiate into a single egg or 64 sperm. A mutation in the gene bag-of-marbles, located on chromosome 3, causes abnormal cyst growth with an abundance of cells that cannot form gametes.

### Escargot
This gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates stem cell maintenance, tracheal morphogenesis and neuroblast differentiation. It is part of the Snail protein family that controls embryonic central nervous system. Mutations in escargot cause defects in abdominal cuticles, wings, and legs causing abdominal sections to shorten and can resemble a snail’s body. Therefore, it was given the name escargot. In human disease models, the gene exacerbates Alzheimer’s disease.

### Swiss Cheese
Swiss cheese encodes a transmembrane protein that regulated neuronal and glial formation. A loss of function in swiss cheese leads to neuronal and glial degeneration and apoptotic cell death. Mutants show degeneration of the nervous system that can be described as “holes in the brain” resembling holes in swiss cheese.

### Hippo (hpo)
Hippo is a serine/threonine kinase. Its’ primary role is to control the growth of tissue and organ size by restricting cell growth and promoting apoptosis. When hippo is mutated in flies the resulting adult phenotype is characterized by an overgrown head with folds around the neck area, hence its name hippo. It is located on the second chromosome and plays an important role in the hippo signaling pathway. Hippo in mammals is called MST1 and MST2.

### Eagle (egl)
Eagle is a transcription factor of the nuclear hormone subfamily. It is located on the third chromosome. It plays a very important role in serotonergic differentiation and axonal path findings.Eagle got its name from the mutated adult phenotype that is characterized by wings that are positioned at right angles instead of the wild type wing morphology. When eagle is mutated serotonin can not be differentiated properly.

###Turnip (tur)
Turnip, or tur, is a little known gene which encodes for a protein involved the pathway of anesthesia-resistant-memory (ARM). The location and structure of this protein is unknown but the pathway leads to protein creation that enables non-neuronal patterning memory. Mutations in tur have memory deficits and olfactory learning problems.

### Tinman(Tin)
Tinman, or Tin, is a homeobox transcription factor which plays a role as an essential early regulator of mesodermal tissue specification.  It is located on the third chromosome. The gene is vital for the formation of a heart and visceral muscle primordia. Flies that are mutant for the tin gene lack a heart, and also express severe visceral and somatic muscle defects. The gene got its name from the character, Tin Man, from Wizard of Oz.

### Sickle 
The Sickle gene lies on chromosome 3L and encodes for a small protein containing an RHG motif and a Trp-block (1.) that binds to inhibitors of apoptosis.  The Sickle protein causes cell death via apoptosis and works with the Grim gene.  It is named Sickle after the grim reaper’s sickle because it causes cell death and works with the Grim gene (2).

### Brainiac
The Brainiac gene lies of the X chromosome and codes for a neurogenic acetylglucosaminyltransferase involved in two distinct events: the notch pathway and brain development and developmental events of oogenesis (3.) (4.).  Flies with a mutation in the Brainiac gene show a defect in the dorsal-ventral patterning of the ovarian follicle such that their dorsal appendages are shifted toward the midline and become fused.  Flies with a mutation in the gene also have neural hyperplasia; this is the mutant phenotype the gene is named after.

### Inebriated  
The Inebriated gene (ine) encodes for a neurotransmitter transporter  that is very similar to the Na+/Cl- dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. These neurotransmitter transporters take up serotonin, GABA , dopamine and norepinephrine, so when defective the mutation causes too much stimulation of the motor neurons in the fly, making it appear inebriated. The double mutants for this gene also have a phenotype of an indented thorax and downward facing wings. While the name may suggest that this gene has to do with alcohol tolerance, it does not. Due to the overstimulation of the neurons, the fly just appears inebriated.

### Nemo
The nemo gene (nmo) plays a role in the regulation of cell dynamics and represses the expression of miple (midkine/ pleiotrophin cytokine) during ommatidial rotation, which is when the photoreceptors are arranged in the dorsal and ventricle fields to form mirror images. It encodes for a MAP like protein kinase necessary for the function of cone cells and it is also responsible for parts of the body plan such as wing morphology and vein mapping. There seems to be no relation for why the gene was named nemo. The author was contacted to inquire but there was no response.

### Homeless (Hls)
Hls is a gene that encodes a protein with sequence homology to DE-H family of RNA-dependent ATPases and putative helicases. Helicases are involved in unwinding of RNA, allowing RNA’s to pass over one and other, and localize properly. Its thought that Hls is involved in organizing cytoskeletal framework essential for localization of specific RNA’s involved in oogenesis. The homeless gene has been shown to be essential to dorsoventral and anteroposterior axis formation in oogenesis, as well as a displaced oocyte phenotype. The displacement of oocytes, and RNA transcripts  gave rise to the name, homeless, the gene has also been named SpnE for its involvement in spindle regulation.  Recent research on the hls gene have shown function in the Ste [Su(Ste)] pathway of male meiosis, spermatogenesis. [Su(Ste)] is a Y linked gene that functions as as a suppressor to Stellate(Ste) in males. Males lacking the Y chromosome locus of the gene show derepression of Stellate that leads to needlelike and crystalline aggregates as well as chromosome disorganization, both of which disrupt meiosis in a number of ways. Knockout of hls has shown similar phenotypes leading to X-Y nondisjunction, chromosome fragmentation, loss of meiotic drive and tripolar meiosis. This is likely due to improper RNA processing and localization of the RNA transcripts of stellate, or [Su(Ste)] yielding derepression of Ste.

### Rutabaga (Rut)
Rut encodes a calmodulin dependent adenylate cylcase that converts ATP to cyclic AMP, cAMP is a major signal transducer in all cells. Calmodulin binds Ca++ ions and causes this conversion. Rutabaga plays a large role in regulating levels of cAMP, and has shown that memory formation requires spatial and temporal regulation of cAMP rather than absolute levels of cAMP.
It is ubiquitously expressed enzyme in the brains of flies and mediates plasticity of the synapses, that gives rise to memory and learning. The decrease in cognitive ability of mutants is synonymously tongue and cheek with the fly being a “vegetable” in the english language, giving the name rutabaga to the fly. It is one of many “vegetable” genes. Studies have shown that an electric shock coupled with odors allows for operant conditioning of flies, rutabaga knockouts do not display such conditioning.
